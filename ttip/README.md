# Type Thoery in Purescript 

I very much want to learn Purescript enough to make simple
programming language demos in it.

The best videos I've found on this topic are the Type Theory & Logic
livestreams by @cvladfp with Denisa. You can see the videos at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T51P_uICy9E&list=PLg0VnzA8LyrHofInH4gVUoOWnWDXo0LOg&index=1

The videos are more about logic (proofs and sequents), but the first two videos 
are exactly what I need because they build a parser and interpreter for the
STLC.
